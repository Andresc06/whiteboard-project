# Canvas Drawing App

This is a real-time collaborative drawing app built with Node.js, Socket.io, and HTML Canvas. Multiple users can connect to the same drawing room and draw simultaneously on different canvases.

## Getting started
To use this application, just start drawing on your canvas and your changes will be synchronized in real-time with the other connected users.

Remember to initialize the server with ```node server.js``` 

## How to use
Once the application is running and you are on the main page, you can start drawing by selecting a color and brush size from the options panel and then clicking and dragging your mouse on the canvas. You can switch between multiple canvas tabs by clicking on the corresponding buttons below the whiteboard.
